In order to run q2main.ipynb, Kaggle or JupyterLab can be used with the "Run All" option or by running each 
cell one by one. While implementing the homework, I used Kaggle. Data files must either be in the same directory 
with the notebook, or the paths of the read_csv calls must be changed accordingly. My implementation starts with a 
data analysis stage where I visualize the training and validation datasets which I load from the csv files using 
Pandas and plot using Seaborn. I then convert the dataframes into NumPy arrays and fit my model onto the data. 
I then make predictions using the validation dataset. I also tuned my hyperparameters according to this stage's 
results during my implementation. Finally, I calculate the confusion matrix with a function and display it with 
a Seaborn heatmap. I then repeat this fit and predict process using a Dirichlet prior. The outputs are all 
labeled with what they are for better understandability.
